# Login-registration-form 
Made with vanilla HTML, CSS and PHP. Simple login and registration form that checks for unique username and email. Password are not hashed and will be stored in plain text, so change that if you are going to use this form! Change SQL query's if you arent going to use the SQL script that is in this repo.
